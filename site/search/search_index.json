The supported authentication method is: OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usernames and passwords are sourced from the Telkom Portal Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. This integration allows users to manage password changes and resets via the Telkom Web GUI, consistent with applications like Telkom Consumer Self Service and the Enterprise Self Service Portal (ESSP). Note: If a user changes their password through the Telkom Web GUI, the API web client implementation must be updated accordingly. Authentication Process To authenticate, follow these steps: 1. Obtain Telkom Portal Credentials Ensure you have a registered username and password on the Telkom Portal. 2. Profile Construction The API Gateway Support team will create a profile linking your credentials to the appropriate Telkom CRM Customer: Phase III \u2013 Onboarding for End-to-End verification environment. Phase IV \u2013 Onboarding for Production environment. Phase II \u2013 Simulator environment (shared credential). \u26a0\ufe0f Ensure neither the username nor password contains control characters or the colon ( : ), which is used as a separator in the BAA scheme.

The following activities are relevant to this phase: Scope Determination: Documenting which operations will be used by the API consumer, which in turn determines the scope items for the Telco internal IT Change Request process, and therefore also the test result schedules. API documentation: Provision of access to API technical documentation. Phase II: Coding and Unit testing Once the documentation is in place, access to a sandbox environment, that simulates the APIs in scope, is granted. The intention of this phase is to allow the consumer to exercise the API, observe typical behaviour, and unit test code, without an assigned ETE environment. The following activities are relevant to this phase: Technical start-up meeting: The API support team, and the API consumer technical team meet to provide a high level description of API usage, and demonstrate of the use of the sandbox. Sandbox Access: Granting of access to a simulator environment for the API operations in scope. API Consumer coding: The writing of software by the API consumer technical team. API development support: The API Support team is available for scheduled sessions to answer questions, provide guidance, and assist with troubleshooting. API Consumer unit testing: The testing of API consumer code, using the API sandbox Completion acceptance: Acceptance of API consumer code for the API operations in scope. End to End test scheduling: The assignment of the API Consumer Onboarding CR to a Scheduled Release. There are four CR Scheduled Releases in a year, and end to end testing for the API Consumer needs to be assigned to one of these. Phase III: End to End testing Once the CR scheduled release window opens, an end to end (ETE) testing environment is assigned, and the complete end to end process for API operations in scope can be validated. The following activities are relevant to this phase: Assignment of CR Project Manager: An IT project manager (PM) is assigned to the CR, to drive delivery. Assignment of ETE environment: The IT PM negotiates for a telco internal platform, with integrated back-end systems, to the Onboarding CR, for the duration of the scheduled release. Preparation of ETE environments: The teams responsible for the various integrated back-end environments deploy production versions of software to their ETE environment integrated platforms, and complete readiness testing (Business Unit Availability Testing). Creation of Test Data: The data entities in the integrated back ends necessary for end to end testing of the API operations in scope are created by the SQA team. Creation of API Consumer Gateway Profile: The profile linked to API Authentication and Authorisation is created on the ETE environment, and API endpoint and access details shared with the API consumer. Sharing of ETE testing data with the API consumer: Details of created and consumable resources, and reference data for the ENT testing is shared with the API Consumer technical team Conducting of End to End testing: API Consumer code for each operation in scope is tested against the End to End environment. ETE Troubleshooting: The API Support team is available for scheduled sessions to answer questions, provide guidance, and assist with troubleshooting of testing failures. Completion acceptance: Acceptance of API consumer code for the API operations in scope, based on successful End to End testing for each API operation. Phase IV: Production implementation Once successful end to end testing has been signed off, a production release date is scheduled. The following activities are relevant to this phase: Creation of Production API Consumer Gateway Profile: The profile linked to API Authentication and Authorisation is created on the production environment, and API endpoint and access details shared with the API consumer.

In order to facilitate development and testing, non-production environments are made available. The API environments are as follows: API Simulator End to End (ETE) Environment Production Environment These environments differ, as detailed in the following sections. API Simulator The API simulator is an instance of the API gateway deployed to a non-production environment, using stubbed internal integration instead of connecting to the various Telco internal systems that the ETE and Production environments do. This environment uses a pre-built profile, shared by all users of the environment. Validation of some attributes in the API payloads does not take place, as it would on any other environment. Specifically, ICCIDs Deal ID, and MSISDNs are not validated. This allows development testing to proceed without the configuration of per API consumer profiles, Deal Sheets, MSISDNs, and SIM inventories. Responses from Telco internal systems are typical of production, and the same results returned for all requests for any specific API operation. For example, in the case of a successful POST Order API operation, the same Order ID and MSISDN will always be returned. Validation of API request json payloads are therefore validated only for specific aspects, such as: Correct http headers Correct Authentication (using a shared credential) Correct json payload structure Simulation of specific failure modes is accommodated, by the inclusion of a http header. This allow for unit testing of API consumer code. Once an API consumer's code is able to successfully call all the API operations in scope, the API consumer can sign-off on unit testing, and proceed to End to End testing. End to End environment (ETE) Use of an ETE is governed by the IT Change Request (CR) process, and is scheduled into a Quarterly Release. To enable use of the ETE environment, some internal preparation is required, that is managed as part of the CR process. Internal preparation includes the following activities, which mimics the production environment: Creation of records in the Telco OSS/BSS systems for the API consumer Customer Creation of a profile with authentication and authorisation detail matching the BSS/OSS system Creation of test data for use on the ETE environment, such as MSISDNs and ICCIDs Determination of Deals IDs valid on the ETE environment Once the preparation is complete API calls can be made by the API consumer, which trigger ordering and service configuration operations in Telco internal OSS/BSS systems of the ETE environment, and API responses provide production realistic values, including validation failures. API requests therefore need to make use of valid values in the URL and payload, such as Account numbers, MSISDNs. Values returned from API operations represent responses and statuses that the API Gateway receives from Telco internal OSS/BSS systems in the ETE environment.
